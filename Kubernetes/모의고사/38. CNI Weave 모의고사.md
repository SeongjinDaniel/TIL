# 38. CNI Weave Practice Test

1. Inspect the kubelet service and identify the network plugin configured for Kubernetes.
   
   **Hint**
   
   - Run the command: `ps -aux | grep kubelet` and look at the configured `--network-plugin` flag.
   
   **Solution**
   
   - Here is an example output that you should see:
     
     ```sh
     root@controlplane:~# ps -aux | grep kubelet | grep --color network-plugin=   
     root      4573  0.0  0.5 2228660 104628 ?      Ssl  13:55   2:50 /usr/bin/kubelet --bootstrap-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml --network-plugin=cni --pod-infra-container-image=k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2
     ```
     
     **Note** the **--color** will highlight the pattern being searched and is quite useful when the line has plenty of characters.
