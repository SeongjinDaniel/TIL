1. How many nodes are part of this cluster?

   Including the master and worker nodes.

   ```
   $ kubectl get nodes
   ```

2. What is the Internal IP address of the `controlplane` node in this cluster?

   ```
   $ kubectl describe node controlplane | grep -i ip
   #or
   $ cat /etc/network/interfacesip link
   $ ip link
   ```

3. What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the master node?

   node-to-node communication

   **Hint**

   - Run the `ip a` / `ip link` command and identify the interface.

   **Solution**

   - Run: `kubectl get nodes -o wide` to see the IP address assigned to the controlplane node.

     ```sh
     root@controlplane:~# kubectl get nodes controlplane -o wide
     NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
     controlplane   Ready    control-plane,master   4h46m   v1.20.0   10.3.116.12   <none>        Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1041-gcp   docker://19.3.0
     root@controlplane:~#
     ```

     In this case, the internal IP address used for node for node to node communication is `10.3.116.12`.

     **Important Note** : The result above is just an example, the node IP address will vary for each lab.

     Next, find the network interface to which this IP is assigned by making use of the `ip a` command:

     ```sh
     root@controlplane:~# ip a | grep -B2 10.3.116.12
     16476: eth0@if16477: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
         link/ether 02:42:0a:03:74:0c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
         inet 10.3.116.12/24 brd 10.3.116.255 scope global eth0
     root@controlplane:~# 
     ```

     Here you can see that the interface associated with this IP is eth0 on the host.

     **Answer**: eth0

   **인강 Solution**

   ```
   $ ifconfig ens3
   ```

   

4. What is the MAC address of the interface on the master node?

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `ip link show eth0`

   ```
   $ ip link show eth0
   ```

5. What is the IP address assigned to `node01`?

   ```
   $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
   ```

6. What is the MAC address assigned to `node01`?

   **인강 Solution**

   ```
   $ ssh node01 ifconfig ens3
   ```

   

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `arp node01` on the controlplane node.

   ```
   $ arp node01
   ```

   **ARP 명령**: (Address Resolution Protocol) IP주소로 MAC 주소를 알기 위한 프로토콜이다. ARP 테이블로 IP 주소에 대한 MAC주소를 확인 할 수 있다.

   **arp -a** : 모든 arp 테이블을 확인 하는 명령어 이다.

7. We use Docker as our container runtime. What is the interface/bridge created by Docker on this host?

   **인강 Solution**

   ```
   $ ssh node01 ifconfig -a
   ```

   

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `ip link` and look for a bridge interface created by docker.

   **Answer**: docker0

8. What is the state of the interface `docker0`?

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `ip link show docker0` and look for the state.

   ```
   $ ip link show docker0
   ```

9. If you were to ping google from the master node, which route does it take?

   What is the IP address of the Default Gateway?

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `ip route show default` and look at for default gateway.

10. What is the port the `kube-scheduler` is listening on in the controlplane node?

    **인강 Solution**

    ```
    $ netstat -natulp | grep kube-scheduler
    ```

    

    **Hint**

    - Use the command `netstat -nplt`

    ```
    $ netstat -nplt
    ```

11. Notice that ETCD is listening on two ports. Which of these have more client connections established?

    ```
    $ netstat -nplt
    ```

    **netstat** 

    - 네트워크 접속, 라우팅 테이블, 네트워크 인터페이스의 통계 정보를 보여주는 도구

    **option** : 

    - **l** (listen) : 연결 가능한 상태
    - **n** (number port) : 포트 넘버
    - **t** (tcp) : tcp
    - u (udp) : udp
    - **p** : 프로그램 이름 / PID
    - a : 모두
    - i : 이더넷 카드별 정상/에러/드랍 송수신 패킷 수 확인
    - r : 라우팅 테이블
    - s : 네트워크 통계

12. Correct! That's because 2379 is the port of ETCD to which all control plane components connect to. 2380 is only for etcd peer-to-peer connectivity. When you have multiple master nodes. In this case we don't.
