# 33. Security Context 모의고사



1. What is the user used to execute the sleep process within the `ubuntu-sleeper` pod?

   In the current(default) namespace.

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `kubectl exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami` and check the user that is running the container.

   ```
   $ kubectl exec ubuntu-sleeper -- whoami
   ```



2. Edit the pod `ubuntu-sleeper` to run the sleep process with user ID `1010`.

   Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name or image of the pod.

   - Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper
   - Image Name: ubuntu
   - SecurityContext: User 1010

   **Hint**

   - Set a security context to run as user `1010`.

   **Solution**

   - To delete the existing `ubuntu-sleeper` pod:

     ```sh
     $ kubectl delete po ubuntu-sleeper
     ```

     After that apply solution manifest file to run as user `1010` as follows:

     ```yaml
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: ubuntu-sleeper
       namespace: default
     spec:
       securityContext:
         runAsUser: 1010
       containers:
       - command:
         - sleep
         - "4800"
         image: ubuntu
         name: ubuntu-sleeper
     ```

     Then run the command `kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml` to create a resource.

     NOTE: TO delete the pod faster, you can run `kubectl delete pod ubuntu-sleeper --force`. This can be done for any pod in the lab or the actual exam. It is not recommended to run this in Production, so keep a note of that.



3. A Pod definition file named `multi-pod.yaml` is given. With what user are the processes in the `web` container started?

   The pod is created with multiple containers and security contexts defined at the `Pod` and `Container` level.

   ```
   $ cat multi-pod.yaml
   ```



4. With what user are the processes in the `sidecar` container started?

   The pod is created with multiple containers and security contexts defined at the `Pod` and `Container` level.

   ```
   $ cat multi-pod.yaml
   ```

   

5. Update pod `ubuntu-sleeper` to run as Root user and with the `SYS_TIME` capability.

   Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the pod.

   - Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper
   - Image Name: ubuntu
   - SecurityContext: Capability SYS_TIME

   **Hint**

   - Add `SYS_TIME` capability to the container's Security Context.

   **Solution**

   - To delete the existing pod:

     ```sh
     $ kubectl delete po ubuntu-sleeper
     ```

     After that apply solution manifest file to add capabilities in `ubuntu-sleeper` pod:

     ```yaml
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: ubuntu-sleeper
       namespace: default
     spec:
       containers:
       - command:
         - sleep
         - "4800"
         image: ubuntu
         name: ubuntu-sleeper
         securityContext:
           capabilities:
             add: ["SYS_TIME"]
     ```

     then run the command `kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml` to create a pod from given definition file.



6. Now update the pod to also make use of the `NET_ADMIN` capability.

   Note: Only make the necessary changes. Do not modify the name of the pod.

   - Pod Name: ubuntu-sleeper
   - Image Name: ubuntu
   - SecurityContext: Capability SYS_TIME
   - SecurityContext: Capability NET_ADMIN

   ```yaml
   To delete the existing pod:
   
   $ kubectl delete po ubuntu-sleeper
   After that apply solution manifest file to add capabilities in ubuntu-sleeper pod:
   
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: ubuntu-sleeper
     namespace: default
   spec:
     containers:
     - command:
       - sleep
       - "4800"
       image: ubuntu
       name: ubuntu-sleeper
       securityContext:
         capabilities:
           add: ["SYS_TIME", "NET_ADMIN"]
   then run the command kubectl apply -f <file-name>.yaml to create a pod from given definition file.
   ```
