   $ kubectl get clusterroles --no-headers | wc -l
   ```

   

2. How many `ClusterRoleBindings` exist on the cluster?

   ```
   $ kubectl get clusterrolebindings --no-headers | wc -l
   ```

   

3. What namespace is the `cluster-admin` clusterrole part of?

   `Answer: Cluster Roles are cluster wide and not part of any namespace`



4. What user/groups are the `cluster-admin` role bound to?

   The ClusterRoleBinding for the role is with the same name.

   $ kubectl describe clusterrolebinding cluster-admin
   ```



5. What level of permission does the `cluster-admin` role grant?

6. <u>A new user `michelle` joined the team. She will be focusing on the `nodes` in the cluster. Create the required `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings` so she gets access to the `nodes`.</u>

   ```
   $ 
   ```

   - Grant permission to list nodes

   **Hint**

   - Use the command `kubectl create` to create a clusterrole and clusterrolebinding for user `michelle` to grant access to the nodes.
     After that test the access using the command `kubectl auth can-i list nodes --as michelle`.

   **Solution**

   Solution manifest file to create a clusterrole and clusterrolebinding for `michelle` user:

   ```yaml
   ---
   kind: ClusterRole
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: node-admin
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["nodes"]
     verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]
   
   ---
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: michelle-binding
   subjects:
   - kind: User
     name: michelle
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: node-admin
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

   After save into a file, run the command `kubectl create -f <file-name>.yaml` to create a resources from definition file.



7. <u>`michelle`'s responsibilities are growing and now she will be responsible for storage as well. Create the required `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings` to allow her access to Storage.</u>

   <u>Get the API groups and resource names from command `kubectl api-resources`. Use the given spec:</u>

   - ClusterRole: storage-admin
   - Resource: persistentvolumes
   - Resource: storageclasses
   - ClusterRoleBinding: michelle-storage-admin
   - ClusterRoleBinding Subject: michelle
   - ClusterRoleBinding Role: storage-admin

   **Hint**

   Use the command `kubectl create` to create a new `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding`.
   Assign it correct `resources` and `verbs`.
   After that test the access using the command `kubectl auth can-i list storageclasses --as michelle`.

   **Solution**

   Solution manifest file to create a clusterrole and clusterrolebinding for `michelle` user:

   ```yaml
   ---
   kind: ClusterRole
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: storage-admin
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["persistentvolumes"]
     verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]
   - apiGroups: ["storage.k8s.io"]
     resources: ["storageclasses"]
     verbs: ["get", "watch", "list", "create", "delete"]
   
   ---
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: michelle-storage-admin
   subjects:
   - kind: User
     name: michelle
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: storage-admin
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

   After save into a file, run the command `kubectl create -f <file-name>.yaml` to create a resources from definition file.
