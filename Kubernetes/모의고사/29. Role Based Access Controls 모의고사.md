# Role Based Access Controls 모의고사



1. Inspect the environment and identify the authorization modes configured on the cluster.

   Check the `kube-apiserver` settings.

   **Hint**

   -  Use the command `kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system` and look for `--authorization-mode`.

   ```
   $ kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kube-system
   ```

2. How many roles exist in the `default` namespace?

   ```
   $ kubectl get roles --no-headers | wc -l
   ```

3. How many roles exist in all namespaces together?

   ```
   $ kubectl get roles -A --no-headers | wc -l
   ```

4. What are the resources the `kube-proxy` role in the `kube-system` namespace is given access to?

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `kubectl describe role kube-proxy -n kube-system`

   ```
   $ kubectl describe role kube-proxy -n kube-system
   ```

5. What actions can the `kube-proxy` role perform on `configmaps`?

   **Hint**

   - Check the `verbs` associated to the `kube-proxy` role.

   **Solution**

   - Run the command: `kubectl describe role -n kube-system kube-proxy` and check under the `Verbs` column.

   ```
   $ kubectl describe role kube-proxy -n kube-system
   
   Name:         kube-proxy
   Labels:       <none>
   Annotations:  <none>
   PolicyRule:
     Resources   Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
     ---------   -----------------  --------------  -----
     configmaps  []                 [kube-proxy]    [get]
   ```

6. Which of the following statements are true?

   **Answer**: kube-proxy role can get details of configmap object by the name kube-proxy

7. Which account is the `kube-proxy` role assigned to it?

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `kubectl describe rolebinding kube-proxy -n kube-system`

8. A user `dev-user` is created. User's details have been added to the `kubeconfig` file. Inspect the permissions granted to the user. Check if the user can list pods in the `default` namespace.

   Use the `--as dev-user` option with `kubectl` to run commands as the `dev-user`.

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `kubectl get pods --as dev-user`

   **Answer**: dev-user does not have permissions to list pods

9. Create the necessary roles and role bindings required for the `dev-user` to create, list and delete pods in the `default` namespace.

   Use the given spec:

   - 
     Role: developer
   - Role Resources: pods
   - Role Actions: list
   - Role Actions: create
   - Role Actions: delete
   - RoleBinding: dev-user-binding
   - RoleBinding: Bound to dev-user

   **Hint**

   - Use the command `kubectl create` to create a role `developer` and rolebinding `dev-user-binding` in the `default` namespace.

   **Solution**

   - To create a Role:- `kubectl create role developer --namespace=default --verb=list,create,delete --resource=pods`
     To create a RoleBinding:- `kubectl create rolebinding dev-user-binding --namespace=default --role=developer --user=dev-user`
     OR

     Solution manifest file to create a role and rolebinding in the `default` namespace:

     ```yaml
     kind: Role
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       namespace: default
       name: developer
     rules:
     - apiGroups: [""]
       resources: ["pods"]
       verbs: ["list", "create","delete"]
     
     ---
     kind: RoleBinding
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: dev-user-binding
     subjects:
     - kind: User
       name: dev-user
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     roleRef:
       kind: Role
       name: developer
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     ```

   ```
   $ kubectl create role developer --verb=list,create,delete --resource=pods
   $ kubectl create rolebinding dev-user-binding --role=developer --user=dev-user
   ```

10. The `dev-user` is trying to get details about the `dark-blue-app` pod in the `blue` namespace. Investigate and fix the issue. We have created the required roles and rolebindings, but something seems to be wrong.

    **Hint**

    - New roles and role bindings are created in the `blue` namespace.
      Check it out the `resourceNames` configured on the role.

    **Solution**

    - Run the command: `kubectl edit role developer -n blue` and correct the `resourceNames` field. You don't have to delete the role.

11. Grant the `dev-user` permissions to create deployments in the `blue` namespace.

    Remember to add both groups `"apps"` and `"extensions"`.

    - Create Deployments

    **Hint**

    - Use the command `kubectl create` to create a role and rolebinding for user `dev-user` to grant permissions to create a deployments in the `blue` namespace.

    **Solution**

    - Solution manifest file to create a role and rolebinding in the `blue` namespace:

      ```yaml
      ---
      kind: Role
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      metadata:
        namespace: blue
        name: deploy-role
      rules:
      - apiGroups: ["apps", "extensions"]
        resources: ["deployments"]
        verbs: ["create"]
      
      ---
      kind: RoleBinding
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      metadata:
        name: dev-user-deploy-binding
        namespace: blue
      subjects:
      - kind: User
        name: dev-user
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      roleRef:
        kind: Role
        name: deploy-role
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      ```
