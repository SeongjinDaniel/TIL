# 46. Application Failure 모의고사



1. **Troubleshooting Test 1:** A simple 2 tier application is deployed in the `alpha` namespace. It must display a green web page on success. Click on the app tab at the top of your terminal to view your application. It is currently failed. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   **Hint**

   - Check the object names and make sure they match the ones given in the architecture diagram.

   **Solution**

   - The service name used for the MySQL Pod is incorrect. According to the Architecture diagram, it should be `mysql-service`.
     To fix this, first delete the current service: `kubectl -n alpha delete svc mysql`
     Then create a new service with the following YAML file (or use imperative command):

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: mysql-service
       namespace: alpha
     spec:
         ports:
         - port: 3306
           targetPort: 3306
         selector:
           name: mysql
     ```

     Create the new service: `kubectl create -f <service.yaml>`

2. **Troubleshooting Test 2:** The same 2 tier application is deployed in the `beta` namespace. It must display a green web page on success. Click on the app tab at the top of your terminal to view your application. It is currently failed. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   **Hint**

   - In the `beta` namespace, check the ports configured on the services.

   **Solution**

   - If you inspect the `mysql-service` in the `beta` namespace, you will notice that the `targetPort` used to create this service is incorrect.
     Compare this to the Architecture diagram and change it to `3306`. Update the `mysql-service` as per the below YAML:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: mysql-service
       namespace: beta
     spec:
         ports:
         - port: 3306
           targetPort: 3306
         selector:
           name: mysql
     ```

3. **Troubleshooting Test 3:** The same 2 tier application is deployed in the `gamma` namespace. It must display a green web page on success. Click on the app tab at the top of your terminal to view your application. It is currently failed. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   - Fix Issue

   **Hint**

   - Inspect the selector used by the `mysql-service`. Is it correct?

   **Solution**

   - If you inspect the `mysql-service`, you will see that that the selector used does not match the label on the mysql pod.

     ```
     Service:
     root@controlplane:~# kubectl -n gamma describe svc mysql-service | grep -i selector
     Selector:          name=sql00001
     root@controlplane:~#
     ```

     
     `Pod:`

     ```
     root@controlplane:~# kubectl -n gamma describe pod mysql | grep -i label   
     Labels:       name=mysql
     root@controlplane:~#
     ```

     As you can see the selector used is `name=sql001` whereas it should be `name=mysql`.
     Update the `mysql-service` to use the correct selector as per the below YAML:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: mysql-service
       namespace: gamma
     spec:
         ports:
         - port: 3306
           targetPort: 3306
         selector:
           name: mysql
     ```

   ```
   $ kubectl -n gamma get all
   $ kubectl -n gamma get ep
   # mysql-service endpoints가 none임
   $ kubectl get svc mysql-service -n gamma -o yaml
   $ clear
   $ kubectl -n gamma describe pod mysql
   $ kubectl -n gamma delete svc mysql-service
   $ kubectl -n gamma expose pod mysql --name=mysql-service
   $ kubectl -n gamma get ep
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting Test 4:** The same 2 tier application is deployed in the `delta` namespace. It must display a green web page on success. Click on the app tab at the top of your terminal to view your application. It is currently failed. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   **Hint**

   - Are the environment variables used by the deployment correct?

   **Solution**

   - Try accessing the web application from the browser using the tab called `app`. You will notice that it cannot connect to the MySQL database:

     ```
     Environment Variables: DB_Host=mysql-service; DB_Database=Not Set; DB_User=sql-user; DB_Password=paswrd; 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'sql-user'@'10.244.1.9' (using password: YES)
     ```

     According to the architecture diagram, the DB_User should be `root` but it is set to `sql-user` in the `webapp-mysql` deployment.
     Use the command `kubectl -n delta edit deployments.apps webapp-mysql` and update the environment variable as follows:

     ```yaml
     spec:
           containers:
           - env:
             - name: DB_Host
               value: mysql-service
             - name: DB_User
               value: root
             - name: DB_Password
               value: paswrd
     ```

     This will recreate the pod and you should then be able to access the application.

   ```
   $ kubectl -n delta describe deployments webapp-mysql
   $ kubectl -n delta get deployments webapp-mysql -o yaml > web.yaml
   $ kubectl delete deployments. wepapp-mysql -n delta
   $ vi web.yaml
   #DB_User 수정
   $ kubectl create -f web.yaml
   $ kubectl -n delta get all
   ```

   

5. **Troubleshooting Test 5:** The same 2 tier application is deployed in the `epsilon` namespace. It must display a green web page on success. Click on the app tab at the top of your terminal to view your application. It is currently failed. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   - Fix Issue

   **Hint**

   - Ensure the right password is configured for the database on the MySQL pod and the Web application.

   **Solution**

   - If you inspect the environment variable called `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, you will notice that the value is incorrect as compared to the architecture diagram:

     ```
     root@controlplane:~# kubectl -n epsilon describe pod mysql  | grep MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD 
           MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:  passwooooorrddd
     root@controlplane:~#
     ```

     Correct this by deleting and recreating the `mysql` pod with the correct environment variable as follows:

     ```yaml
     spec:
       containers:
       - env:
         - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
           value: paswrd
     ```

     Also edit the `webapp-mysql` deployment and make sure that the DB_User environment variable is set to `root` as follows:

     ```yaml
     spec:
           containers:
           - env:
             - name: DB_Host
               value: mysql-service
             - name: DB_User
               value: root
             - name: DB_Password
               value: paswrd
     ```

     Once the objects are recreated, and you should be able to access the application.

   ```
   $ kubectl -n epsilon get all
   
   ```

   

6. fix the issue.

   Stick to the given architecture. Use the same names and port numbers as given in the below architecture diagram. Feel free to edit, delete or recreate objects as necessary.

   **Hint**

   - Inspect the ports used by the `web-service` is it correct? Are the environment variable used as per the architecture diagram?

   **Solution**

   There are a few things wrong in this setup:

   **1.** If you inspect the `web-service`, you will see that the `nodePort` used is incorrect.
   This service should be exposed on port `30081` and NOT `30088`.

   ```
   root@controlplane:~# kubectl -n zeta get svc web-service 
   NAME          TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   web-service   NodePort   10.102.190.212   <none>        8080:30088/TCP   3m1s
   root@controlplane:~#
   ```

   
   To correct this, delete the service and recreate it using the below YAML file:

   ~~~yaml
   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: web-service
     namespace: zeta
   spec:
     ports:
     - nodePort: 30081
       port: 8080
       targetPort: 8080
     selector:
       name: webapp-mysql
     type: NodePort
   ~~~

   

   **2.** Also edit the `webapp-mysql` deployment and make sure that the DB_User environment variable is set to `root` as follows:

   ```yaml
   spec:
         containers:
         - env:
           - name: DB_Host
             value: mysql-service
           - name: DB_User
             value: root
           - name: DB_Password
             value: paswrd
   ```


   **3.** The `DB_Password` used by the `mysql` pod is incorrect. Delete the current pod and recreate with the correct environment variable as per the snippet below:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     containers:
     - env:
       - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
         value: paswrd
   ```

   Once the objects are recreated, and you should be able to access the application.
