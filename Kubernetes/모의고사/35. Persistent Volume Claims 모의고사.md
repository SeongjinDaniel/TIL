# 35. Persistent Volume Claims 모의고사



1. We have deployed a POD. Inspect the POD and wait for it to start running.

   In the current(default) namespace.

2. The application stores logs at location `/log/app.log`. View the logs.
   You can exec in to the container and open the file:
   `kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log`

3. If the POD was to get deleted now, would you be able to view these logs.

   **Answer** : No

4. ***Configure a volume to store these logs at `/var/log/webapp` on the host.***

   ***Use the spec provided below.*** _———–> 왜 document에서 복사해서 사용하면 에러가 나지?

   - Name: webapp
   - Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
   - Volume HostPath: /var/log/webapp
   - Volume Mount: /log

   **Hint**

   - Use the command `kubectl run` to create a pod and use the flag `--dry-run=client -oyaml` to generate the manifest file.
     In the manifest file add `spec.volumes` and `spec.containers.volumeMounts` property.

   **Solution**

   Solution manifest file to create a `webapp` pod with given properties as follows:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: webapp
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: event-simulator
       image: kodekloud/event-simulator
       env:
       - name: LOG_HANDLERS
         value: file
       volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: /log
         name: log-volume
   
     volumes:
     - name: log-volume
       hostPath:
         # directory location on host
         path: /var/log/webapp
         # this field is optional
         type: Directory
   ```

   Then run the command `kubectl create -f <file-name>.yaml` to create a pod.

5. Create a `Persistent Volume` with the given specification.

   - Volume Name: pv-log
   - Storage: 100Mi
   - Access Modes: ReadWriteMany
   - Host Path: /pv/log
   - Reclaim Policy: Retain

   **pv-log.yaml**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolume
   metadata:
     name: pv-log
   spec:
     capacity:
       storage: 100Mi
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteMany
     persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
     hostPath:
       path: /pv/log
   ```

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f pv-log.yaml
   ```

6. Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a `Persistent Volume Claim` with the given specification.

   - Volume Name: claim-log-1
   - Storage Request: 50Mi
   - Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce

   **pvc-log.yaml**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: claim-log-1
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 50Mi
   ```

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f pvc-log.yaml
   ```

7. What is the state of the `Persistent Volume Claim`?

   ```
   $ kubectl get pvc
   ```

   **Answer**: PENDING

8. What is the state of the `Persistent Volume`?

   ```
   $ kubectl get pv
   ```

   **Answer**: AVAILABLE

9. Why is the claim not bound to the available `Persistent Volume`?

   **Answer**: Access Modes Mismatch

10. Update the Access Mode on the claim to bind it to the PV.

    Delete and recreate the `claim-log-1`.

    **Hint**

    - Set the Access Mode on the PVC to `ReadWriteMany`.

    **Solution**

    - To delete the existing pvc:

      ```
      $ kubectl delete pvc claim-log-1
      ```

      Solution manifest file to create a `claim-log-1` PVC with correct `Access Modes` as follows:

    ```yaml
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: claim-log-1
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 50Mi
    ```

    Then run `kubectl create -f <file-name>.yaml`

11. You requested for `50Mi`, how much capacity is now available to the PVC?

    **Hint**

    - Run the command: `kubectl get pvc` and look under the `capacity` section.

    ```
    $ kubectl get pvc
    ```

12. Update the `webapp` pod to use the persistent volume claim as its storage.

    Replace `hostPath` configured earlier with the newly created `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

- Name: webapp
- Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
- Volume: PersistentVolumeClaim=claim-log-1
- Volume Mount: /log

**log.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: event-simulator
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /log
      name: log-volume

  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: claim-log-1
```

```
$ kubectl apply -f log.yaml
```

13. What is the `Reclaim Policy` set on the Persistent Volume `pv-log`?

```
$ cat pv-log.yaml
```

14. What would happen to the PV if the PVC was destroyed?

    **Answer**: The PV is not deleted but not available

15. Try deleting the PVC and notice what happens.

    **Answer**: The PVC is stuck in 'terminating' state

16. Why is the PVC stuck in `Terminating` state?

    **Answer**: The PVC is being used by a POD

17. Let us now delete the `webapp` Pod.

    Once deleted, wait for the pod to fully terminate.

    - Name: webapp

18. What is the state of the PVC now?

    **Answer**: Deleted

19. What is the state of the Persistent Volume now?

    **Answer**: Released
