# 42. CoreDNS in Kubernetes



1. Identify the DNS solution implemented in this cluster.

   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system` and look for the DNS pods.

   ```
   $ kubectl get pods -n kube-system
   ```



2. How many pods of the DNS server are deployed?
   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get deploy -n kube-system` and look for Desired count of `coredns`.



3. What is the name of the service created for accessing CoreDNS?
   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get service -n kube-system`



4. What is the IP of the CoreDNS server that should be configured on PODs to resolve services?
   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get service -n kube-system` and look for cluster IP value.



5. Where is the configuration file located for configuring the CoreDNS service?
   - **Hint**
     - Inspect the `Args` field of the coredns deployment and check the file used.
   - **Solution**
     - Run the command: `kubectl -n kube-system describe deployments.apps coredns | grep -A2 Args | grep Corefile`



6. How is the Corefile passed in to the CoreDNS POD?

   - **Hint**
     - Use the `kubectl get configmap` command for `kube-system` namespace and inspect the correct ConfigMap.
   - **Solution**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get cm -n kube-system` and look at the `coredns` ConfigMap. It's passed through the ConfigMap volume in the deployment.

   **Answer**

   Configured as a ConfigMap object



7. What is the name of the ConfigMap object created for Corefile?
   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl get configmap -n kube-system` and identify the name.



8. What is the root domain/zone configured for this kubernetes cluster?
   - **Hint**
     - Run the command: `kubectl describe configmap coredns -n kube-system` and look for the entry after kubernetes.



9. We have deployed a set of PODs and Services in the `default` and `payroll` namespaces. Inspect them and go to the next question.



10. What name can be used to access the `hr` web server from the `test` Application?

    You can execute a curl command on the `test` pod to test. Alternatively, the test Application also has a UI. Access it using the tab at the top of your terminal named `test-app`.

    - **Hint**
      - Use the command `kubectl get svc` after viewing the available services, write the correct service name and port.
