# 34. Network Policies 모의고사



1. How many network policies do you see in the environment?

   We have deployed few web applications, services and network policies. Inspect the environment.

   **Hint**

   - Run the command: `kubectl get networkpolicy` or `kubectl get netpol`

   ```
   $ kubectl get netpol
   ```



2. What is the name of the Network Policy?

   ```
   $ kubectl get netpol
   ```



3. Which pod is the Network Policy applied on?

   ```
   $ kubectl get netpol
   $ kubectl get pods -l name=payroll
   or
   $ kubectl get pod -o wide --show-labels
   or
   $ kubectl describe netpol
   ```



4. What type of traffic is this Network Policy configured to handle?

   ```
   $ kubectl describe netpol
   ```



5. What is the impact of the rule configured on this Network Policy?

   ```
   $ kubectl describe netpol
   or
   $ kubectl describe netpol payroll-policy
   ```

   `Answer: Traffic From Internal to Payroll POD is allowed`



6. What is the impact of the rule configured on this Network Policy?

   ```
   $ kubectl describe netpol
   or
   $ kubectl get pods -l name=internal
   ```

   `Answer: Internal POD can access port 8080 on Payroll POD`



7. Access the UI of these applications using the link given above the terminal.

8. Perform a connectivity test using the User Interface in these Applications to access the `payroll-service` at port `8080`.

   `Answer: Only Internal application can access payroll service`



9. <u>Perform a connectivity test using the User Interface of the Internal Application to access the `external-service` at port `8080`.</u>

   `Answer: Successful`

   

10. Use the spec given on the below. You might want to enable ingress traffic to the pod to test your rules in the UI.

    - 
      Policy Name: internal-policy
    - Policy Type: Egress
    - Egress Allow: payroll
    - Payroll Port: 8080
    - Egress Allow: mysql
    - MySQL Port: 3306

    **Solution**

    Solution manifest file for a network policy `internal-policy` as follows:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: internal-policy
      namespace: default
    spec:
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: internal
      policyTypes:
      - Egress
      - Ingress
      ingress:
        - {}
      egress:
      - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: mysql
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3306
    
      - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: payroll
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
    
      - ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
        - port: 53
          protocol: TCP
    ```

    Note: We have also allowed Egress traffic to TCP and UDP port. This has been added to ensure that the internal DNS resolution works from the internal pod. Remember: The kube-dns service is exposed on port 53:

    ```
    root@controlplane:~# kubectl get svc -n kube-system 
    NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
    kube-dns   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   93m
    root@controlplane:~#
    ```
