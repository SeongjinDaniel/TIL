# Scheduling 모의고사



1. A pod definition file nginx.yaml is given. Create a pod using the file.

   Only create the POD for now. We will inspect its status next.

   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
   ```

   



2. What is the status of the created POD?

   ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   ```



3. Why is the POD in a pending state?

   Inspect the environment for various kubernetes control plane components.

   `Solution: `

   `Run the command: kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system to see the status of scheduler pod. We have removed the scheduler from this Kubernetes cluster. As a result, as it stands, the pod will remain in a pending state forever.`

   ```
   $ kubectl -n kube-system get pods
   
   보시다시피 여기에는 다른 controlplane 구성 요소가 나열되어 있습니다.
   그러나 누락된 부분이 하나 있습니다. 바로 kube 스케줄러입니다.
   이것이 우리가 이전에 만든 pod가 현재 보류 상태인 이유입니다.
   
   Answer: No scheduler present
   ```



4. Manually schedule the pod on `node01`.

   Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.

   - Status: Running
   - Pod: nginx

   `Solution:`

   ```yaml
   Delete the existing pod first. Run the below command:
   
   $ kubectl delete po nginx
   To list and know the names of available nodes on the cluster:
   
   $ kubectl get nodes
   Add the nodeName field under the spec section in the nginx.yaml file with node01 as the value:
   
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     nodeName: node01
     containers:
     -  image: nginx
        name: nginx
   Then run the command kubectl create -f nginx.yaml to create a pod from the definition file.
   
   To check the status of a nginx pod and to know the node name: 
   
   $ kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

   

5. Now schedule the same pod on the `controlplane` node.

   Delete and recreate the POD if necessary.

   - Status: Running
   - Pod: nginx
   - Node: controlplane

   `Solution`

   ```yaml
   Delete the existing pod first. Run the below command:
   
   $ kubectl delete po nginx
   To list and know the names of available nodes on the cluster:
   
   $ kubectl get nodes
   Update the value of the nodeName field to controlplane:
   
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     nodeName: controlplane
     containers:
     -  image: nginx
        name: nginx
   Then run the command kubectl create -f nginx.yaml to create a pod from the definition file.
   
   To check the status of a nginx pod and to know the node name: 
   
   $ kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```
